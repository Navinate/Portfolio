                    Ye Olde Snails is a WIP minecraft mod I am making with a few friends.  The mod is based off of illuminated manuscripts that depicted giant snails fighting knights.  I think this concept fits really well into the fantasty style of Minecraft while also staying light-hearted.
                    So far we have implemented a common snail mob, some basic crafting items, and a set of armor and weapons.  I personally have done texture art, 3D modelling, and some code implementation.
