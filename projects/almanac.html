                    I was hired to create an interactive gallery where people 
                    could upload their own designs to be added to the exhibit.  
                    For this project I worked with two JavaScript libraries I was unfamiliar with to implement image uploading and cropping right into the page.  
                    This allows users to easily resize and frame their concept art before uploading to the gallery.  
                    It uses a PHP backend to facilitate image uploading and displaying the images in the gallery.
                </p>
