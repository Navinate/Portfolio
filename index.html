                    This is a website I created for an art exhibition. The site features a place to upload images for the exhibition including built in image cropping while uploading.

                    I upload a lot of my animations on <a href="https://codepen.io/navinate">CodePen</a>. It is a website for people to experiment with and share small pieces of web-dev code.  I mainly use it to animate using css.  I really find it fascinating how using only html and css people can create these vast scenes of motion and design.

                    A Minecraft mod written in Java that I am working on with my friends.  Adds snails and medieval weapons based off of artwork in illuminated manuscripts.  I use this as an outlet to teach myself more professional Java practices.  I textured a few snail items, modeled the snails, and coded functionality of scooping snails into buckets. VERY WORK IN PROGRESS.
